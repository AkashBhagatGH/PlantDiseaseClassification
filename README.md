# Plant Disease Classification

# üåø Plant Disease Classification

Plant Disease Classification is a deep learning-based project that identifies and classifies diseases in plants from leaf images. This system helps farmers and agricultural experts diagnose plant health quickly and accurately, enabling timely intervention and improved crop management.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify plant leaf images into multiple disease categories. It automates the detection of common plant diseases, reducing reliance on manual inspection and expert knowledge.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Accurate Disease Detection** from leaf images using deep learning.
- **Multi-class Classification** for various plant diseases.
- **Preprocessing** includes image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- **Model Training** with popular CNN architectures.
- **Evaluation Metrics** such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **User-friendly Interface** (optional) to upload leaf images and get disease prediction.
